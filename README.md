# Engineering application of bioinspired algorithms based on cerebellar architecture

In order to investigate bioinspired algorithms based on cerebellar architecture used for modeling mechanical systems consisting of the above basic elements, the author developed a specialized software engine in Python and JavaScript.
The basic input data for it is the definition of the number, links and properties:
- for each node - coordinates and their derivatives in time reflecting phase space parameters.
- for each spring - free distance, elasticity coefficient, resistance coefficient, numbers of bodies in the arrays that are connected by the spring.
The simplest constructions and the process of changing their state in time NandS.ipynb are presented below:
